Risks are a major problem in projects, they can slow things to a grinding halt if not properly dealt with and mitigated.

##### Risk 1:
Difficulty in hardware and software integration.\
With the project utilizing cameras, operating systems and robotics the integration of hardware and software can lead to issues down the line.
regular testing of the software on the operating systems as well as frequent integration with the hardware will avoid major issues.

#### Risks Associated With This Project
|Rank|Name/Description|Occurrence Probability<br/>(H/M/L)|Severity<br/>(H/M/L)|Mitigation Strategy Number|Contingency|
|:-:|:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-|
|1|Difficulty in integrating hardware and software components|H|H|1|Consider alternative hardware and software components|
|2|Lack of expertise in computer vision and robotics|H|H|2|Provide training and development opportunities for team members|
|3|Inability to meet project deadlines due to unforeseen circumstances|M|H|3|Establish project management plan that includes contingency and flexibility in timelines|
|4|Changes in project requirements or objectives|M|M|4|Regularly review and update project requirements and objectives with all stakeholders|
|5|Inadequate communication and collaboration among project team members|L|M|5|Establish communication + collaboration protocols, facilitate regular meetings + check-ins|
|6|Difficulty in sourcing required materials or equipment|L|M|6|Develop comprehensive list of required materials + equipment, identify potential suppliers + alternatives|

# SCHEDULE
## PROJECT TIME LINE
> *[Given the tasks (group as activities) in Section 4.2, schedule each tasks using a Gantt chart or some other type of time line.*\
> *You do not have to use Microsoft Project.*\
> *Acceptable Gantt charts can be created using Excel or various graphics programs or can be hand-drawn]*
>
> *[For each task, show the deadline, and who is allocated to each task (your team members).*\
> *Often it is better to allocate two people to each task in case one becomes unavailable (e.g., breaks a leg)]*

## EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES
> *[Describe any inputs from external parties that are required to ensure that the schedule is met.*\
> *These dependencies, if any, must also be indicated in the time line (Section 7.1) as a critical point]*

## ASSUMPTIONS
> *[Describe any assumptions that have been made in arriving at the schedule.*\
> *These may be critical to the implementation of the software]*

<div class="page"/><!-- page break -->

# BUDGET
> *[Summarise in a table the rate per hour for each of the team member.*\
> *Look for an appropriate rate per work when doing such type of project.*\
> *Using the role listed in Section 1.2.3, complete the table below]*

#### Personnel Cost
|Name|Rate per Hour|
|:-|:-:|
|||
|||
|||

**Table 3 Personnel Cost**
> *[List all the tasks (grouped as activities) described in Section 4.2 in a table and estimate the number of hours needed to complete each task]*

#### Time Estimated to Complete Each Task
|Activity|Task|Estimated hours needed (hrs)|Total per activity (hrs)|
|:-:|:-|:-:|:-:|
|1|A|10||
||B|15||
||C|20||
||D|5|50|
|||||
||F|5|10|
|||Total||
|||||

**Table 4 Task Time Estimate**
> *[As a guide in estimating the time consider the following:]*
>
> *[Each team member should contribute equally, and time spent actually writing software should be about*
> *(200 hours x number of team members, ie, about 10 hours per week per member, excluding lectures) across the 2 semesters,*\
> *Total time allocation for each student should not exceed 10 hours per week,*\
> *The total hours per activity should be feasible within the schedule defined in Section 7.1]*
>
> *[Note that the schedule in Section 7.1 includes slack time]*
