# RISKS
Risks are a major problem in projects, they can slow things to a grinding halt if not properly dealt with and mitigated.

##### Risk 1:
Difficulty in hardware and software integration.\
With the project utilising cameras, operating systems and robotics the integration of hardware and software can lead to issues down the line.\
Regular testing of the software on the operating systems as well as frequent integration with the hardware will avoid major issues.

##### Risk 2:
Lack of expertise in computer vision and robotics.\
As mentioned in the first risk this project is integrated with a robotics system.\
With many people not working directly with robots a lack of experience is common, 
however risks are easily mitigated with training and research into the system.

##### Risk 3:
Inability to meet project deadlines.\
in the duration of a project things will affect the deadlines be that team members falling ill,
supervisors requesting work sooner, or even clients needing code faster.\
A general mitigation strategy is to be organised, utilising project boards can help, also regular meetings to be aware of issues. 
Overall this is a hard to mitigate risk as problems can arise quickly.

##### Risk 4:
Changes in project requirements or objectives.\
As mentioned above, change in objectives can change the deadline timing, making it harder to achieve in most cases.
However the larger issue is a change in objectives can change the budget, often demanding a time crunch or stretched resources.\
To mitigate this issue a strong and verbose scope should be established at the beginning of the project, 
and moving forward any changes to the scope must include additional modification of the deadlines.

##### Risk 5:
Inadequate communication and collaboration among project team members.\
In projects teams often have to be led by a team member, this leader is responsible for ensuring the work submitted is acceptable.
They are also there to ensure the team is working and collaborating effectively, if this isn't occuring work will be completed slower and usually not withing deadlines.\
Mitigation strategies are having a good leader as well as utlising proper organisation.

##### Risk 6:
Difficulty in sourcing required materials or equipment.\
As projects grow in size so too does the cost, this growing cost is partly due to required materials and equipment.
The risk being that if for example, the camera was mounted upside down and ordering a replacement part were to take weeks,
do you proceed forward or wait for the  required materials.\
To mitigate this issue multiple tasks should be completed simultaniously so that when equipment becomes availible they are used quickly and the project is back on track.

#### Risks Associated With This Project
|Rank|Name/Description|Occurrence Probability<br/>(H/M/L)|Severity<br/>(H/M/L)|Mitigation Strategy Number|Contingency|
|:-:|:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-|
|2|Difficulty in hardware and software intergration|H|M|1|revert back to working build, test more frequently from said build|
|4|Lack of expertise in computer vision and robotics|H|L|2|Provide immediate training for team members from an expert|
|1|Inability to meet project deadlines|M|H|3|Meet with the client or supervisor and discuss options|
|5|Changes in project requirements or objectives|L|M|4|Change deadlines or task priority to accomodate changes|

# SCHEDULE
## PROJECT TIME LINE
> *[Given the tasks (group as activities) in Section 4.2, schedule each tasks using a Gantt chart or some other type of time line.*\
> *You do not have to use Microsoft Project.*\
> *Acceptable Gantt charts can be created using Excel or various graphics programs or can be hand-drawn]*
>
> *[For each task, show the deadline, and who is allocated to each task (your team members).*\
> *Often it is better to allocate two people to each task in case one becomes unavailable (e.g., breaks a leg)]*

## EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES
> *[Describe any inputs from external parties that are required to ensure that the schedule is met.*\
> *These dependencies, if any, must also be indicated in the time line (Section 7.1) as a critical point]*

## ASSUMPTIONS
> *[Describe any assumptions that have been made in arriving at the schedule.*\
> *These may be critical to the implementation of the software]*

<div class="page"/><!-- page break -->

# BUDGET
> *[Summarise in a table the rate per hour for each of the team member.*\
> *Look for an appropriate rate per work when doing such type of project.*\
> *Using the role listed in Section 1.2.3, complete the table below]*

#### Personnel Cost
|Name|Rate per Hour|
|:-|:-:|
|||
|||

**Table 3 Personnel Cost**
> *[List all the tasks (grouped as activities) described in Section 4.2 in a table and estimate the number of hours needed to complete each task]*

#### Time Estimated to Complete Each Task

**Table 4 Task Time Estimate**
> *[As a guide in estimating the time consider the following:]*
>
> *[Each team member should contribute equally, and time spent actually writing software should be about*
> *(200 hours x number of team members, ie, about 10 hours per week per member, excluding lectures) across the 2 semesters,*\
> *Total time allocation for each student should not exceed 10 hours per week,*\
> *The total hours per activity should be feasible within the schedule defined in Section 7.1]*
>
> *[Note that the schedule in Section 7.1 includes slack time]*
