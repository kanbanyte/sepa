## PROJECT 24.
### Title:
`Robot Vision System For A Pick And Place Task`

### Description:
The robot at the Factory of the Future is performing pick and place tasks without any sensing or vision guided system.\
The position of the object to pick and place is predefined.\
If the object is not in the predefined position, the robot cannot perform the pick and place task.

This project aims to provide the robot with a vision or sensing system to perform pick and place tasks.

### Specialisations Area:
Computer Vision; Sensors; Robotics; AI.

### Skills:
Software Programming;

### Environment:
C/C++; Python; OpenCV; PyTorch; Robot Operating System.

### Research Component:
State of the art technologies to provide the robot with a vision system to pick and place objects.
