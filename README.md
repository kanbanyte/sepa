## Unit Summary
**Note that the lectures are to be conducted live online via Canvas/Collaborate-Ultra.**

**In general, project meetings in project teams (with or without the project supervisor, or with the client) may be conducted on campus (eg, in the library),**
**on client site or online, with agreement from all involved.**

### Aims
Students will consolidate and build on skills and knowledge gained in previous related studies and team work and
apply these to a practical application and/or research project.\
Students will also present results and/or findings in a substantial piece of work.

### Unit Learning Outcomes
Students who successfully complete this unit will be able to:
1. Apply professional practice, including active and consistent participation, delivery of technical presentations, reflection, and
adherence to ethical codes of conduct as a member of a software development team\
[K3, K6, A1, A2, and A5]
2. Apply software engineering methods and contemporary software development tools to the scoping, analysis, and design of a software system to meet client needs\
[K4, K5, S1, S2, S3, and A4]
3. Communicate proficiently with project stakeholders, and
function as an effective member or leader of a development team in project scoping, analysis and design activities\
[S2, S3, A2, and A7]
4. Conduct a critical analysis and evaluation of aspects relevant to a software development project and justify implications for project directions\
[S4, A5, and A6]

### Graduate Attributes
This unit may contribute to the development of the following Swinburne Graduate Attributes:
* Communication 1 - Verbal communication
* Communication 2 - Communicating using different media
* Teamwork 1 - Collaboration and negotiation
* Teamwork 2 - Teamwork roles and processes
* Digital literacies 1 - Information literacy

#### Minimum requirements to pass this Unit
To pass this unit, you must achieve an overall mark for the unit of 50% or more.

#### Examinations
There are no formal examinations in this Unit of Study.

#### Submission Requirements
Assignments and other assessments are generally submitted online through the
Canvas assessment submission system which integrates with the Turn-it-in plagiarism checking service.

Please ensure you keep a copy of all assessments that are submitted.

In cases where a hard copy submission is required an Assessment Cover Sheet must be submitted with your assignment.\
The standard Assessment Cover Sheet is available from the Submitting work webpage or\
<https://www.swinburne.edu.au/studentforms/>

#### Extensions and Late Submission
Extensions to assessable items will only be granted in exceptional circumstances on medical or compassionate grounds.\
Extensions must be applied for in advance of the assessable item's due date and the convener of this Unit of Study must approve the extension in writing.

Where submissions are group submissions no extensions will be granted.

Late Submissions: unless an extension has been explicitly granted by the Unit of Study convener, you cannot submit an assessable item after the due date.\
If this does occur, you will be penalised 10% of the assessments worth for each calendar day the task is late - up to a maximum of 5 days.\
After 5 days a zero result will be recorded.\
Feedback or comments from the marker will generally not be available on assignments that are submitted after five working days past the published deadline.

#### Referencing
To avoid plagiarism, you are required to provide a reference whenever you include information from other sources in your work.

Referencing conventions for assessable documents are to be negotiated with the project supervisor in advance.

Helpful information on referencing can be found at:\
<http://www.swinburne.edu.au/library/referencing/>

#### Group Work Guidelines
A group assignment is the collective responsibility of the entire group, and
if one member is temporarily unable to contribute, the group should be able to reallocate responsibilities to keep to schedule.\
In the event of longer-term illness or other serious problems involving a member of group,
it is the responsibility of the other members to notify immediately the Unit Convenor or relevant tutor/supervisor.

Group submissions must be submitted with an Assignment Cover Sheet, signed by all members of the group.

All group members must be satisfied that the work has been correctly submitted.\
Any penalties for late submission will generally apply to all group members, not just the person who submitted.

*Students are encouraged to use unallocated time between the lecture and tutorial for assignment work with their group!*
