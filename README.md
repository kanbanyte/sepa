#### Minimum requirements to pass this Unit
To pass this unit, you must achieve an overall mark for the unit of 50% or more.

**Examinations**\
There are no formal examinations in this Unit of Study.

#### Submission Requirements
Assignments and other assessments are generally submitted online through the Canvas assessment submission system
which integrates with the Turn-it-in plagiarism checking service.

Please ensure you keep a copy of all assessments that are submitted.\

In cases where a hard copy submission is required an Assessment Cover Sheet must be submitted with your assignment.\
The standard Assessment Cover Sheet is available from the Current Students web site.

#### Extensions and Late Submission
Extensions to assessable items will only be granted in exceptional circumstances on medical or compassionate grounds.\
Extensions must be applied for in advance of the assessable item's due date and the convener of this Unit of Study must approve the extension in writing.

Where submissions are group submissions no extensions will be granted.\

Late Submissions: unless an extension has been explicitly granted by the Unit of Study convener, you cannot submit an assessable item after the due date.\
If this does occur, you will be penalised 10% of the assessments worth for each calendar day the task is late - up to a maximum of 5 days.\
After 5 days a zero result will be recorded.\
Feedback or comments from the marker will generally not be available on assignments that are submitted after five working days past the published deadline.

#### Referencing
To avoid plagiarism, you are required to provide a reference whenever you include information from other sources in your work.

Referencing conventions for assessable documents are to be negotiated with the project supervisor in advance.

Helpful information on referencing can be found at <http://www.swinburne.edu.au/library/referencing/>

#### Group work Guidelines
A group assignment is the collective responsibility of the entire group,
and if one member is temporarily unable to contribute, the group should be able to reallocate responsibilities to keep to schedule.\
In the event of longer-term illness or other serious problems involving a member of group,
it is the responsibility of the other members to notify immediately the Unit Convenor or relevant tutor.

Group submissions must be submitted with an Assignment Cover Sheet, signed by all members of the group.\

All group members must be satisfied that the work has been correctly submitted.\
Any penalties for late submission will generally apply to all group members, not just the person who submitted.
